## About

This is a quick and dirty jekyll pages installation to post developer needs from the Kathmandu Living Labs in response to the Great Earthquake. 

This app frame is built using the [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) responsive framework and Jekyll pages. 

## Dependencies
- Download and install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to update locally. 
- [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) is already installed within this repository

## Setup

- Clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/kathmandulivinglabs/quake-tasks.git`

- Begin by creating a new _posts/ markdown file for a new task.
- Build the Jekyll `_site/` folder by running `jekyll build` in your directory. I recommend running `jekyll build --watch`, which automatically rebuilds your `_site` folder whenever you change something in the directory.
- Run the jekyll server by running `jekyll serve`. You can now see your page at [](http://localhost:4000/)
- Push changes to github, see website running remotely at kathmandulivinglabs.github.io/quake-tasks
- tweet out your new tasks using the bit.ly link bit.ly/quaketasks
