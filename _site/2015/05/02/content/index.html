<h1>Help us build a paper map server for field workers</h1>

<p>We're looking to create a coordinated series of static maps using the <a href="https://github.com/maposmatic/ocitysmap">ocitysmap</a> python module from <a href="http://www.maposmatic.org/">MapOSMatic</a>. Here's how it would work.
- Create a grid of highly effected areas of Nepal (We have this information).
- Create high res maps using OCitysMap of these areas.
- Update these maps on a cron job 1 to 2 times a day.
- Serve these maps on our site, <a href="kathmandulivinglabs.org">kathmandulivinglabs.org</a>.</p>

<p>If you are interested in helping set up a server that would run OCitysMap and auto update some printable pdf maps for field workers to download at will, let me know by emailing me at daniel.j.wood11@gmail.com</p>
